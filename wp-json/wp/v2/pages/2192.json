An excise tax is an indirect tax that is not paid by the customers directly. Instead, it is imposed on the supplier or the producer, who then includes it in the product price. Federal, state, and local governments impose excise taxes. The taxes can either be applied as a percentage of a product or services&#8217; total cost or services or a fixed amount. As a business owner, it is your responsibility to collect and pay the appropriate authority taxes. The tariffs are charged in two ways the percentage of the price or per unit.

Multiple research reports suggest that participating in online purchases changes the way buyers perceive their entire customer experience, whether as consumer or business buyers. Changes can be felt most acutely in the retail sector, but the customer experience trend extends into all areas of cross-border e-commerce. Consumers want access to products from around the globe, and they expect fast hassle-free fulfillment. That expectation puts the weight of managing the logistical nuances of global trade regulations square on the shoulders of the seller. And getting it right matters quite a bit. That means import-export businesses that want a piece of the proverbial e-commerce pie need to nail down their behind-the-scenes processes to create a seamless customer experience regardless of whether their customer sits 50 or 5,000 miles away. Import-export trade businesses will also want to screen for any restricted items at the point of purchase. As products are moved on and off sanctioned party lists frequently, up-to-date alerts on compliance changes ensure products don&#8217;t get caught in Customs (and help businesses avoid the associated fines, too). E-Commerce is changing the way businesses operate, including with regard to customer experience. With consumer demand for a top-notch customer experience at an all-time high and the margins of profitability fairly slim, experts recommend businesses dealing in import-export trade work to maximize the efficiency of their fulfillment processes to remain competitive. Barcode is a machine-readable code in the form of a number and a pattern of parallel lines of varying widths, printed on and identifying a product. Barcode systems help businesses and organizations track products, prices, and stock levels for centralized management in computer software allowing for incredible productivity and efficiency. The lines and patterns on a barcode are representatives of numbers and data. Their development allowed basic information about a product to easily read by an optical scanning device, a barcode scanner, and automatically entered into a computer system. Barcodes come in many shapes and sizes and a wide range of designs, and many can even be read by mobile phones and other devices. Barcodes work through the combination of symbology and a scanner that can read the symbols and convert them into useful information, often information about an item&#8217;s origin, price, type, and location. The scanner reads the barcode and automatically enters the information stored in it into a system \u2013 often some database type.

Benefits of consolidated shipments include cost savings, reduced chance of damages, and speed to market. Some challenges include trouble finding a carrier, organization and planning, and time. Consolidated shipping is a way to get shipments to their destinations cheaply and efficiently.

Detention: refers to the customer&#8217;s costs for using equipment beyond the given free time, typically outside of the terminal. It is charged when the carrier&#8217;s equipment is still used by the shipper or consignee beyond LFD, regardless of whether full or empty.

NMFC codes were born when regulators within the transportation industry realized there was a need for more effective standardization. The 18 freight classes are defined with a number between 50 and 500. These numbers become essential when shippers and carriers need to define tariffs associated with a given shipment and set shipping rates to be charged to the customer. Freight class is based on four primary factors density, storability, ease of handling, and liability. These factors define the freight class, which allows shippers to know what it will cost to move the freight.

Dumping occurs when foreign manufacturers sell goods in the US at less than fair value. Countervailing cases are when a foreign government provides enough subsidies and tax benefits for their manufacturers to sell their goods more cheaply than US manufacturers. Both situations, dumping and countervailing, lead to foreign undercutting of US manufacturers&#8217; prices. Anti-dumping duties are calculated at a company-specific level, where the actual duty amount makes up for the gap between foreign manufacturing and fair market value. Countervailing duties are determined on a country-specific level, and the duty rates counteract the subsidy or foreign government assistance&#8217;s value to exactly level the playing field.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_accordion_item][et_pb_accordion_item title=&#8221;What is MPF\/HMF?&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.7.1&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; open=&#8221;off&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The merchandise processing fee (MPF) is a fee imposed by US Customs and Border Protection to offset salaries and other expenses incurred in the processing of imports and release of merchandise into the United States.

For the majority of imports, it is the final phase of importing. The final tally is determined based on the rate of duty that correlates with the HTSUS code of goods. At the time of entry, the importer pays the estimated duties for their goods based on the HTSUS codes. At the time of Liquidation, CBP assesses if this estimated amount was correct. If CBP concludes that a higher amount is owed than the amount paid, a supplemental duty bill will be issued for the amount still owed. If a lower amount was due, CBP would refund the difference back to the importer. If the duty refund or advancement is less than $20, Customs will not refund the amount or issue a supplemental duty bill.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_accordion_item][et_pb_accordion_item title=&#8221;What is hazmat?&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.7.1&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; open=&#8221;off&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hazmat is an abbreviation for &#8220;hazardous materials&#8221; \u2013 substances in quantities or forms that may pose a reasonable risk to health, property, or the environment.

Duties vary based on the vehicle type; percentages are based on what you paid for the vehicle itself. Cars are charged 2.5%. Trucks are charged 25%, and motorcycles are free of duty or charged 2.4% depending on their cylinder sizes. Is your vehicle 25 years old? You&#8217;re in luck; it&#8217;s considered an &#8220;antique&#8221; and therefore subject to fewer requirements. If your car is younger than 25 years old, the process of importing can be a challenge to navigate.

The purpose of requiring the documentation and the vehicle is so that CBP officers have the necessary time to physically examine the vehicle. Customs examines the submitted documentation and, if accepted, releases a stamp on the titles, which allows the vehicle to be exported. As part of the export, you must provide proof of ownership in the form of a manufacturer&#8217;s statement of origin or a private individual&#8217;s certificate of title.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_accordion_item][et_pb_accordion_item title=&#8221;What is an SLI?&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.7.1&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; open=&#8221;off&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shipper Letter of Instructions: A letter from the exporter instructs the freight forwarder on how and where to handle the export shipment. The exporter is granting permission to the forwarder to act as the authorized forwarding agent for US export control and customs. The SLI contains all the information concerning the shipment from collection to delivery in one document, making it easier for a freight forwarder to process the shipment. When providing an SLI to the carrier, the shipper has a written confirmation that all specifications, requirements, and special needs concerning their cargo were passed on to the carrier. The exporter or shipper fills out or completes the SLI in advance in order to provide it to the freight forwarder.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_accordion_item][et_pb_accordion_item title=&#8221;What is intermodal transport?&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.7.1&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; open=&#8221;off&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intermodal freight transport involves the transportation of freight in an intermodal container or vehicle, using multiple modes of transportation without any handling of the freight itself when changing modes. The method reduces cargo handling and improves security, reduces damage and loss, and allows freight to be transported faster. Reduced costs over road trucking are the key benefit for inter-continental use. This may be offset by reduced timings for road transport over shorter distances. Intermodal transportation is most suitable for intermediate and finished goods in load units of less than 25 tons.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_accordion_item][et_pb_accordion_item title=&#8221;What about warehouse withdrawals?&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.7.1&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; open=&#8221;off&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Physical deposit in a warehouse not needed<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> All or any part of the merchandise covered by an entry summary, Customs Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent, may be withdrawn for transportation without deposit in a bonded warehouse and may be permitted to remain on the vessel or other vehicle or on the pier in a constructive warehouse status pending examination.

The Lacey Act combats trafficking in &#8220;illegal&#8221; wildlife, fish, and plants. The 2008 farm bill (the food conservation and energy act of 2008), effective May 22, 2008, amended the Lacey Act by expanding its protection to a border range of plants and plant products. The Lacey Act now, among other things, makes it unlawful to import certain plants and plant products without an import declaration. Today, the Lacey Act is used primarily to prevent the importation or spread of potentially dangerous non-native species.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_accordion_item][et_pb_accordion_item title=&#8221;What is a TSCA certificate?&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.7.1&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; open=&#8221;off&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Toxic Substances Control Act places requirements on those importing chemicals into or exporting chemicals out of the United States&#8217; customs territory.

Certain chemicals require no certification. Any person who exports or intends to export a chemical substance or mixture subject to certain TSCA regulations must notify the Agency.

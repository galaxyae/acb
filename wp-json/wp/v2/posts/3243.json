These challenges are often due to robust regulations and processes put into place by U.S. Customs &amp; Border Protection (CBP) and other Partner Government Agencies (PGA). The most difficult outcome being the possibility of your goods being held in customs indefinitely, with no clear avenue to retrieve them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where companies can benefit from the services of an experienced customs broker. Customs brokers are licensed by CBP and are aware of the laws, taxes, documentation and processes needed to smoothly import goods.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to knowing the laws and financial needs required for international trade, we also arrange transportation for your items and help you to solve issues with your shipment that would otherwise take the common business owner a great deal of time and money to maneuver.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What\u2019s Special About A Customs Brokerage?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Above and Beyond Service<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can expect us to deliver above your expectation each time as we make sure our employees are experts in the areas, but also have the personality to best serve our clients.

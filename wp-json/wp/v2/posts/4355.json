At the recent Coverings trade show, we had the chance to catch up with Gabriel and Fernando Rodriguez, the driving force behind A Customs Brokerage. In this interview, they share their experiences at the show and discuss how making personal connections has played an instrumental role in their success.<\/p>\n<p>The Interview:<\/p>\n<p><em>It&#8217;s great to have you both here at the Coverings trade show. Tell us, what do you find most valuable about attending events like this?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Gabriel: Thank you for having us. One of the main benefits of attending trade shows like Coverings is the opportunity to connect with potential clients, partners, and suppliers from the industry. It&#8217;s a fantastic platform for building relationships and establishing our presence in the industry.<\/p>\n<p>Fernando: I couldn&#8217;t agree more. Networking and making personal connections are essential for success in our business. People prefer to work with someone they know and trust, and events like this allow us to create those connections.<\/p>\n<p><em>Could you share some examples of how making personal connections at trade shows has led to new business opportunities for A Customs Brokerage?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Fernando: Sure! At this year&#8217;s show, I had a great conversation with a manufacturer from Italy. We discussed the challenges of international shipping and how our customs brokerage services could help streamline their operations. This connection could potentially lead to a new client for our business.<\/p>\n<p>Gabriel: Similarly, I connected with a distributor from Brazil at the show. We bonded over our shared love of soccer, and by the end of the conversation, they expressed interest in working with us to handle their imports. It&#8217;s amazing how casual conversations can open doors for new opportunities.<\/p>\n<p><em>Interviewer: It&#8217;s clear that establishing new connections is essential. However, how do you nurture existing relationships in this kind of setting?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Gabriel: Nurturing relationships is just as vital as establishing new ones. Trade shows like Coverings allow us to meet some of our long-time clients in person and strengthen our relationships with them. It&#8217;s essential to show that we value their business and are committed to their success.<\/p>\n<p>Fernando: Exactly. Attending these events also helps us stay informed about the latest trends and innovations in the industry. By staying at the forefront of our field, we can offer our clients the best possible service and support.<\/p>\n<p>Gabriel and Fernando Rodriguez&#8217;s experiences at the Coverings trade show demonstrate the importance of personal connections and networking in the world of business. By engaging with others, finding common ground, and nurturing relationships, businesses can unlock new opportunities and pave the way for continued success.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In today&#8217;s fast-paced world, it&#8217;s easy to overlook the value of personal connections and networking in the business world.

This law allows the government to seek repayment and punitive fees for any fraudulently filed claims. Most upstanding businesses assume their company is safe from such legal action, but many could still face trouble unless they pay special attention to contract terms and legal requirements.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully, you could save yourself the worry and cost of FCA violations by familiarizing yourself with your legal and contractual obligations under the FCA. To get started, here are the four vital facts about the FCA that everyone in the transportation, freight, and shipping industries should know:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>The FCA Started as War Protections but Now Applies to All Kinds of Fraud.<\/strong> According to the US Department of Justice, the act was \u201coriginally enacted in 1863 in response to defense contractor fraud during the American Civil War.\u201d Passed during the Lincoln administration, the FCA is sometimes referred to as the Lincoln Law. The DOJ further explains that law applies to \u201cany person who knowingly submitted false claims to the government.\u201d Recently, the DOJ has used the FCA to crack down on what they see as mishandled Transportation Industry contracts. The Transportation Industry\u2019s inherent risks make occasional losses a common occurrence, so insurance claims often come up. This level of risk makes it necessary for transportation companies to comply with their contract terms strictly. Otherwise, any claim filed can be considered fraudulent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\" start=\"2\"><li><strong>Non-Compliance Costs Way More Than the Amount of the Original Claim. <\/strong>The FCA allows for significant fines on top of repaying any fraudulent claim. The DOJ states that \u201cviolators are liable for treble damages plus a penalty that is linked to inflation.\u201d Their statement goes on to explain that such fraud cases are not rare, stating, \u201cThe Department of Justice obtained more than $2.2 billion in settlements and judgments from civil cases involving fraud and false claims against the government in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, 2020.\u201d<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>3. <strong>The FCA Allows Private Citizens to Sue on Behalf of the Government. And They Do. <\/strong>FCA suits commonly involve Whistleblowers from the company itself. And it\u2019s no wonder, considering how informants are often compensated. In addition to the benefits of protecting government interests, the Department of Justice explains that \u201cPrivate citizens who successfully [sue through the FCA] may receive a portion of the government\u2019s recovery.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. <strong>Recently, The DOJ has Used the FCA Against Transportation and Shipping Agencies More Often. <\/strong>According to the international law firm Hogan Lovells The DOJ has increased its use of the FCA to regulate transportation since 2015. For example, 2019 saw the DOJ reaching multi-million-dollar settlements with companies like United Parcel Service (UPS) and American Airlines Inc. The report by Hogan Lovells concludes that \u201cDOJ intends to aggressively enforce federal law against government contractors,\u201d and advises, \u201cThese inherent risks of contracting with the government need to be managed and mitigated in an appropriate manner.\u201d They also call for companies that contract with the federal government to ensure all regulations and stipulations are to prevent fraud accusations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A similar report by the law firm of Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher LLP has confirmed that this trend carried on into 2021. Now midway through the year, the report says, \u201cwith nearly $400 million in FCA settlements in the first half of the year, more aggressive and forward-leaning FCA enforcement may well be on the horizon.\u201d Notable settlements so far in 2021 involved companies both big and small, including a laboratory in California, Connecticut electrical contractors, a Washington aerospace contractor, and several United States-based airlines and transportation firms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t let the increased enforcement against transportation claims take you by surprise. With enough preparation and attention to government contracts, companies can safely, legally, and profitably operate for years to come.

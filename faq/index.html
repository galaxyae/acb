				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix"><p>A Customs bond is a contract between three parties: Customs, a principal/importer, and a surety. The bond is like an insurance policy. It ensures that all the duties and fees associated with importing with Customs and other government activities are paid to Customs by the principal. It is a requirement by CBP regulations 19 CFR 113, and the beneficiary is CBP. The minimum continuous bond is valued at $50,000 and covers your ISF declaration and Customs clearance. Have more questions or need a bond? Contact ACB, and we can assist you with obtaining your Customs Bond!</p></div>

				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title">What is required when importing alcoholic beverages into the United States?</h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix"><p>Here are some tips you should know before you ship. Alcoholic beverages fall under three agencies: Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, FDA, and CBP. You&#8217;ll need a special TTB permit, which you can apply online, or if you&#8217;re not computer savvy, print application and mail in. You should receive a response within six weeks. You will need to comply with labeling stating the country of origin, age of Alcohol, and a percentage per bottle. CBP will require a certificate of origin to determine various factors, including duty rates, duty preferences, violation of US Trade quotas, and sanctions against a specific country or product.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix"><p> Internal taxes are levied on selling specific goods and services, such as Alcohol, fuel, and tobacco. An excise tax is an indirect tax that is not paid by the customers directly. Instead, it is imposed on the supplier or the producer, who then includes it in the product price. Federal, state, and local governments impose excise taxes. The taxes can either be applied as a percentage of a product or services&#8217; total cost or services or a fixed amount. As a business owner, it is your responsibility to collect and pay the appropriate authority taxes. The tariffs are charged in two ways the percentage of the price or per unit. To do this, the owner must fill form 720, a quarterly federal excise tax return and list the products they&#8217;ve collected these excise taxes for, and report to the government.</p></div>

The IMO sets standards for the safety and security of international shipping. It oversees every aspect of the worldwide shipping regulations, including legal issues and shipping efficiencies. Their role is to create a level playing field so that ship operators cannot address their financial issues by simply cutting corners and compromising safety. By doing this, they are promoting innovation and efficiency. International shipping transports more than 80 percent of global trade to people and communities all over the world. Shipping is the most efficient and cost-effective method of international transportation. IMO measures cover all things international shipping from ship design, equipment, operation, and disposal.</p></div>

Multiple research reports suggest that participating in online purchases changes the way buyers perceive their entire customer experience, whether as consumer or business buyers. Changes can be felt most acutely in the retail sector, but the customer experience trend extends into all areas of cross-border e-commerce. Consumers want access to products from around the globe, and they expect fast hassle-free fulfillment. That expectation puts the weight of managing the logistical nuances of global trade regulations square on the shoulders of the seller. And getting it right matters quite a bit. That means import-export businesses that want a piece of the proverbial e-commerce pie need to nail down their behind-the-scenes processes to create a seamless customer experience regardless of whether their customer sits 50 or 5,000 miles away. Import-export trade businesses will also want to screen for any restricted items at the point of purchase. As products are moved on and off sanctioned party lists frequently, up-to-date alerts on compliance changes ensure products don&#8217;t get caught in Customs (and help businesses avoid the associated fines, too). E-Commerce is changing the way businesses operate, including with regard to customer experience. With consumer demand for a top-notch customer experience at an all-time high and the margins of profitability fairly slim, experts recommend businesses dealing in import-export trade work to maximize the efficiency of their fulfillment processes to remain competitive. Barcode is a machine-readable code in the form of a number and a pattern of parallel lines of varying widths, printed on and identifying a product. Barcode systems help businesses and organizations track products, prices, and stock levels for centralized management in computer software allowing for incredible productivity and efficiency. The lines and patterns on a barcode are representatives of numbers and data. Their development allowed basic information about a product to easily read by an optical scanning device, a barcode scanner, and automatically entered into a computer system. Barcodes come in many shapes and sizes and a wide range of designs, and many can even be read by mobile phones and other devices. Barcodes work through the combination of symbology and a scanner that can read the symbols and convert them into useful information, often information about an item&#8217;s origin, price, type, and location. The scanner reads the barcode and automatically enters the information stored in it into a system – often some database type. This tool has helped many businesses keep track of inventory and assets.</span></p></div>

It refers to the process of preparing and delivering a customer&#8217;s order. While catalog companies and larger operations typically are equipped to handle customer order fulfillment themselves, eCommerce companies and smaller businesses often hand over that aspect of the business to companies that specialize in fulfillment. Shipping a customer&#8217;s order often involves more than simply putting it in a box and dropping it off at the post office. Fulfillment companies take care of warehousing, producing or assembling the product, packing the order, labeling the order, shipping it using a major carrier, notifying the customer, and processing payment. </span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consolidated shipping is a shipping method where a consolidator combines individual LCL shipments from various shippers into one full container shipment. Participating in consolidated shipping earns the shipper preferred rates. When the full container shipment reaches its destination, the shipments are then deconsolidated into their original LCL shipments. Benefits of consolidated shipments include cost savings, reduced chance of damages, and speed to market. Some challenges include trouble finding a carrier, organization and planning, and time. Consolidated shipping is a way to get shipments to their destinations cheaply and efficiently. Shippers must understand the way consolidation works and consolidation options so that they can properly plan deliveries. An essential aspect of successful consolidated shipping is using a reliable consolidator with industry experience so you can be sure your shipments will be taken care of.</span></p></div>

Types of US Customs inspection holds are Manifest hold, CET Hold, PGA/Commercial Enforcement Hold, and Statistical validation hold. When CBP tags your container for an inspection, they will conduct a customs exam to decide if they should confiscate or release the cargo. There are three types of customs exams: X-ray exam – container is scanned using an X-ray machine. The tailgate exam: the container is inspected at the pier. The intensive exam: the entire container is taken to a customs exam site (CES), where it is emptied to its contents by an authorized agent.</span></p></div>

Think of it as where a product is born. On import/export shipments, a country of origin certificate is important for determining whether goods can be legally imported/exported. The purpose of marking is to inform the ultimate purchaser in the United States of the country in which the imported article was made. The marking must be legible and should be located in a conspicuous place. The best form of marking becomes a part of the article itself, such as branding, stenciling, stamping, printing, molding, and similar methods.</span></p></div>

They declare the &#8216;nationality&#8217; of the product and also serve as a declaration by the exporter to satisfy customs or trade requirements. COs are requested by customs, banks, private stakeholders, and importers for several purposes. Almost every country in the world requires CO for customs clearance procedures: when determining the duty that will be assessed on the goods or, in some cases, whether the goods may be legally imported at all. Certificate of Origin is usually unnecessary unless otherwise indicated, particularly when the importing country is applying some trade remedies to certain products originating in certain countries.</span></p></div>

Importers use the code to determine the duties due to imported products. Requesting a binding ruling essentially asks Customs to say whether or not they agree with the classification the importer has chosen. And if Customs accepts the classification and provides a binding ruling for the product, every port of entry is required to honor that classification. Binding rulings provide uniformity across all entry ports and protect the importer from variations in interpretation from current and future CBP personnel.</span></p></div>

The alternatives to LTL carriers are parcel carriers or full truckload carriers. Parcel carriers usually handle small packages and freight that can be broken down into units less than 150 pounds. LCL stands for less than a container load. Since LCL shipments fill less than a full shipping container, they are grouped with other cargo, which is why they are sometimes called groupage shipments. Shipping fewer goods more frequently mean spending less on inventory space. FCL (full container load) is an ocean shipment in which the cargo occupies a full container (of any size). An FCL shipment can be stuffed at the supplier and then trucked directly to the CY (container yard): The container can either be live unloaded at the destination, or the trucker can do a drop. </span><a href="https://www.freightratecentral.com/Trucking/truckload-shipping-services"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FTL shipping</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stands for full truckload, meaning that the shipment will take up an entire truck by itself.

				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Motor Freight Traffic Association created a classification system for every type of freight. NMFC codes were born when regulators within the transportation industry realized there was a need for more effective standardization. The 18 freight classes are defined with a number between 50 and 500. These numbers become essential when shippers and carriers need to define tariffs associated with a given shipment and set shipping rates to be charged to the customer. Freight class is based on four primary factors density, storability, ease of handling, and liability. These factors define the freight class, which allows shippers to know what it will cost to move the freight. If shippers and carriers fail to determine a freight class or classify freight incorrectly, this can lead to extreme inefficiencies and even dangerous situations.</span></p></div>

Therefore, a party&#8217;s ability to claim relief for a force majeure event depends upon the terms of the contract and the force majeure provision in particular. Force majeure provisions are express terms and will not ordinarily be implied into contracts governed by English law. A party affected by such an event of force majeure will typically be relieved from performing the obligation affected for the duration and the extent affected and entitled to compensation.</span></p></div>

Dumping occurs when foreign manufacturers sell goods in the US at less than fair value. Countervailing cases are when a foreign government provides enough subsidies and tax benefits for their manufacturers to sell their goods more cheaply than US manufacturers. Both situations, dumping and countervailing, lead to foreign undercutting of US manufacturers&#8217; prices. Anti-dumping duties are calculated at a company-specific level, where the actual duty amount makes up for the gap between foreign manufacturing and fair market value. Countervailing duties are determined on a country-specific level, and the duty rates counteract the subsidy or foreign government assistance&#8217;s value to exactly level the playing field.</span></p></div>

For the majority of imports, it is the final phase of importing. The final tally is determined based on the rate of duty that correlates with the HTSUS code of goods. At the time of entry, the importer pays the estimated duties for their goods based on the HTSUS codes. At the time of Liquidation, CBP assesses if this estimated amount was correct. If CBP concludes that a higher amount is owed than the amount paid, a supplemental duty bill will be issued for the amount still owed. If a lower amount was due, CBP would refund the difference back to the importer. If the duty refund or advancement is less than $20, Customs will not refund the amount or issue a supplemental duty bill.</span></p></div>

This process allows one company to send information to another company electronically rather than with paper. Business entities conducting business electronically are called trading partners. Many business documents can be exchanged using EDI, but the two most common are purchase orders and invoices. At a minimum, EDI replaces the mail preparation and handling associated with traditional business communication. EDI&#8217;s real power is that it standardizes the information communicated in business documents, which makes possible a &#8220;paperless&#8221; exchange. The process improvements that EDI offers are significant and can be dramatic.</span></p></div>

				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title">What is an EIN/IRS?</h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An employer identification number is also known as a federal tax identification number and identifies a business entity. Generally, businesses need an EIN. The EIN is a nine-digit number assigned by the IRS. It&#8217;s used to identify the tax accounts of employers and certain others who have no employees. The IRS uses the number to identify taxpayers who are required to file various business tax returns. EIN&#8217;s are used by employers, sole proprietors, corporations, partnerships, non-profit associations, trusts, estates of decedents, government agencies, certain individuals, and other business entities. To ensure fair and equitable treatment for all taxpayers, the IRS limits EIN issuance to one per responsible party. The internal revenue service is the revenue service of the United States federal government. The government agency is a bureau of the Department of Treasury. It is under the immediate direction of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, appointed to a five-year term by the President of the United States.</span></p></div>

				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title">Do I need registration with customs?</h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBP Form 5106 is used to identify the importer of records to US Customs &amp; Border Protection. It is typically used by surety agents when filing a bond, customs brokers for a new client, or importers to establish or change their number or address. If an importer does not have an employer&#8217;s identification number (EIN) or Social Security Number, the form is used to assign a number. It is also used to establish and record a 2-digit suffix to the EIN to separately identify business units and unincorporated divisions of a corporation. Section 114 of the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act (TFTEA) called for CBP to &#8220;establish an importer of record program to assign and maintain importer of records numbers.&#8221; The revised form is now called the Create/Update Importer Identity Form, and it has two new mandatory data elements. These are an email address for the IOR, the type of address for its mailing, and, if applicable, its physical location address.</span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you do not have an entity or presence in the United States, and you want to import goods into the US, you need to be established as a Foreign Importer of Record. You ultimately need to import into the US to be established as a Foreign Importer of records. To do so, you will need a Customs Assigned importer of records number and a Customs Bond. Your Customs broker can help you obtain a Customs Assigned Number. You will be asked to provide a Customs Power of Attorney, a copy of your Articles of Incorporation, a copy of a document that empowers the officers with authority to sign the Power of Attorney, and scans or pictures of the ID.</span></p></div>

				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title">What is an airway bill/bill of lading?</h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An AWB or air consignment note is a receipt issued by an international airline for goods and evidence of the carriage contract; it is a document of title to the goods. The airway bill is non-negotiable. The AWB is the most important document issued by a carrier either directly or through its authorized agent. It is a non-negotiable transport document that covers the transport of cargo from airport to airport. Airway bills have eleven-digit numbers that can be used to make bookings, check the delivery status, and current position of shipment. Bill of lading is a document issued by a carrier to acknowledge receipt of cargo for shipment. A bill of lading must be transferable and serves three main functions:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; it is a conclusive receipt, i.e., an acknowledgment that the goods have been loaded</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; it contains or evidences the terms of the contract of carriage</span></p>

				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; </span><b>Transloading</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The process of transferring a shipment from one mode of transportation to another. It is most commonly employed when one mode cannot be used for the entire trip, such as when goods must be shipped internationally from one inland point to another. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; </span><b>Cross Dock</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: This is a practice in logistics of unloading materials from an incoming semi-trailer truck or railroad car and loading these materials directly into outbound trucks, trailers, or rail cars, with little or no storage in between.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; </span><b>Pick and Pack</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: A type of order fulfillment used most often by eCommerce retailers that receive small orders that are shipped around the globe. This process gives pick and pack workers easy access to items and saves handling time when organized correctly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Storage: This is the activity of storing products at warehouses and logistics centers. Its role is to provide a steady supply of goods to the market to fill the temporal gap between producers and consumers. It plays an important role in maintaining quality at warehouses and logistics centers and value products. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; </span><b>Labeling</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Display information about a product on its container, packaging, or the product itself. For several types of consumer and industrial products, the type and extent of information imparted by a label is governed by the relevant safety and shipping laws.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211;</span><b>Warehouse Services</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: a building for storing goods. Warehouses are used by manufacturers, importers, exporters, wholesalers, transport businesses, customs, et.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solid wood packing material wood packing other than that comprises wholly of wood-based products such as plywood, particleboard, oriented strand board, veneer, wood, wool, etc., which has been created using glue, heat, pressure, or a combination of thereof. This includes pallets, crating, packing blocks, drums, cases, load board, pallet collars, skids, etc. The fumigation certificate, sometimes referred to as a pest-control certificate, is a document that serves as confirmation that any wooden packing materials (i.e., pallets) used in a cargo shipment have been fumigated. They contain details such as treatment purpose, fumigants used, and temperature range. Fumigation will eradicate all pests that have invaded and ensure that no pests will be sealed inside when ongoing exterior pest treatments are implemented.</span></p></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">International Standards For Phytosanitary Measures No.15 was developed by the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) that directly addresses the need to treat wood materials of a thickness greater than 6mm, used to ship products between countries. Its main purpose is to prevent international transport and spread disease and insects that could negatively affect plants or ecosystems. ISPM 15 affects all wood packaging material (pallets, crates, dunnage, etc.), requiring that they be debarked and then heat-treated or fumigated with methyl bromide and stamped or branded, with a mark of compliance. This mark of compliance is colloquially known as the &#8220;wheat stamp.&#8221; Products exempt from the ISPM 15 are made from an alternative material, like paper, plastic, or wood panel products.</span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customs requires several documents before a car can be shipped into the US; you will be the shipper or carriers original bill of lading, a bill of sale for the vehicle, any foreign registration / original title, EPA Form 3520-1, DOT Form HS-7 and any other documents covering the vehicle. Duties vary based on the vehicle type; percentages are based on what you paid for the vehicle itself. Cars are charged 2.5%. Trucks are charged 25%, and motorcycles are free of duty or charged 2.4% depending on their cylinder sizes. Is your vehicle 25 years old? You&#8217;re in luck; it&#8217;s considered an &#8220;antique&#8221; and therefore subject to fewer requirements. If your car is younger than 25 years old, the process of importing can be a challenge to navigate. Hit us up for more info.</span></p></div>

The purpose of requiring the documentation and the vehicle is so that CBP officers have the necessary time to physically examine the vehicle. Customs examines the submitted documentation and, if accepted, releases a stamp on the titles, which allows the vehicle to be exported. As part of the export, you must provide proof of ownership in the form of a manufacturer&#8217;s statement of origin or a private individual&#8217;s certificate of title.</span></p></div>

The SLI contains all the information concerning the shipment from collection to delivery in one document, making it easier for a freight forwarder to process the shipment. When providing an SLI to the carrier, the shipper has a written confirmation that all specifications, requirements, and special needs concerning their cargo were passed on to the carrier. The exporter or shipper fills out or completes the SLI in advance in order to provide it to the freight forwarder.</span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Intermodal freight transport involves the transportation of freight in an intermodal container or vehicle, using multiple modes of transportation without any handling of the freight itself when changing modes. The method reduces cargo handling and improves security, reduces damage and loss, and allows freight to be transported faster. Reduced costs over road trucking are the key benefit for inter-continental use. This may be offset by reduced timings for road transport over shorter distances. Intermodal transportation is most suitable for intermediate and finished goods in load units of less than 25 tons.</span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lacey Act is a conservation law in the United States that prohibits trade in wildlife, fish, and plants that have been illegally taken, possessed, transported, or sold. The Lacey Act combats trafficking in &#8220;illegal&#8221; wildlife, fish, and plants. The 2008 farm bill (the food conservation and energy act of 2008), effective May 22, 2008, amended the Lacey Act by expanding its protection to a border range of plants and plant products. The Lacey Act now, among other things, makes it unlawful to import certain plants and plant products without an import declaration. Today, the Lacey Act is used primarily to prevent the importation or spread of potentially dangerous non-native species.</span></p></div>

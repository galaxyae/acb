				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><strong>At A Customs Brokerage, service has always been more than a promise, it&#8217;s the foundation upon which our company was built.</strong> From the onset, our founders envisioned a company that would not only excel in logistics but also serve as a force for good, spreading positivity wherever possible. This commitment has taken shape in various ways, from our Concierge Service, which offers unparalleled customer care, to our involvement in charitable initiatives like Sneaker Impact, Catholic Charities, Missionaries of Charity, and now, our newest partnership with BLUE Missions.</p>
<p>Our connection to BLUE Missions runs deep, rooted in shared values and community ties. Many of our employees are proud alumni of Christopher Columbus High School, where the spirit of service is instilled in every student. The founder of BLUE Missions, Danny Rodriguez, is also a Columbus alumnus, and the organization often calls on the school’s students and graduates to volunteer for mission trips that bring clean water systems to communities in need. Several of our A Customs Brokerage employees have had the privilege of participating in these missions, working hands-on to provide access to clean water, access that is often a catalyst for hope and opportunity.</p>
<p>When BLUE Missions introduced their Water For All program, which calls on businesses to pledge direct support to this vital cause, we knew we had to be part of it. Our president Gabriel Rodriguez met with Danny and Richard Sixto, the BLUE Development Director, to explore how A Customs Brokerage could contribute meaningfully to this initiative. <strong>We’re proud to announce that A Customs Brokerage has pledged to donate a percentage of revenue from every shipment we handle to support BLUE Missions’ efforts.</strong> These contributions will go towards critical projects like installing sustainable water systems in underserved communities, creating sanitation stations, and furthering the education on the cause worldwide, ensuring that more people have access to the life-sustaining resource that many of us take for granted.</p>
<p>Through this partnership, we are extending our purpose of service even further, and we hope that our actions will inspire others to join us in making a difference. When businesses and individuals come together with a shared mission, we can achieve remarkable things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Country of Origin (C/O) marking plays a critical role in the global trade industry. It is essential for importers to comply with these regulations to avoid shipment delays, inspections, and potential penalties. Recently, there has been a significant increase in C/O marking deficiencies on flooring shipments. This post highlights the importance of proper C/O marking on all shipments, with a particular emphasis on flooring.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding Country of Origin Marking:</strong></p>
<p>Country of Origin marking is a requirement for all imported goods entering the United States. It helps Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials determine the country where the product was made, ensuring the proper assessment of duties and compliance with trade agreements. Importers must comply with these regulations to avoid inspections, delays, and potential penalties.</p>
<p><strong>The Importance of C/O Marking on Shipments:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Compliance with Regulations: Proper C/O marking is a legal requirement, and failure to comply can result in penalties, fines, or even seizure of the goods.</li>
<li>Streamlining Customs Process: Accurate C/O marking helps expedite the customs clearance process, ensuring timely delivery and reducing the risk of shipment delays.</li>
<li>Transparency and Consumer Confidence: C/O markings provide consumers with information about the product&#8217;s origin, allowing them to make informed purchasing decisions and supporting fair competition among manufacturers.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Specific Focus on Flooring Shipments:</strong></p>
<p>Flooring shipments have recently experienced a high percentage of C/O marking deficiencies. As a result, it is crucial for importers in this sector to ensure their shipments have the correct markings to avoid unnecessary inspections and delays. Here are some tips for flooring importers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Verify Markings: Inspect recent shipments to ensure proper C/O markings are in place. Make sure the markings are visible, legible, and permanent.</li>
<li>Work with Suppliers: Collaborate with your suppliers to ensure they understand the importance of accurate C/O marking and provide them with clear guidelines on marking requirements.</li>
<li>Conduct Regular Audits: Implement a system to regularly audit your shipments for C/O marking compliance, helping to identify and address any issues promptly.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Proper Country of Origin marking is crucial for all imported goods, including flooring. Ensuring compliance with these regulations not only keeps your business in good standing with the CBP but also helps streamline the customs process, maintain consumer confidence, and prevent shipment delays. Be proactive in verifying the C/O markings on your shipments, working closely with suppliers, and conducting regular audits to maintain compliance and avoid potential issues.</p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>In today&#8217;s fast-paced world, it&#8217;s easy to overlook the value of personal connections and networking in the business world. At the recent Coverings trade show, we had the chance to catch up with Gabriel and Fernando Rodriguez, the driving force behind A Customs Brokerage. In this interview, they share their experiences at the show and discuss how making personal connections has played an instrumental role in their success.</p>
<p>The Interview:</p>
<p><em>It&#8217;s great to have you both here at the Coverings trade show. Tell us, what do you find most valuable about attending events like this?</em></p>
<p>Gabriel: Thank you for having us. One of the main benefits of attending trade shows like Coverings is the opportunity to connect with potential clients, partners, and suppliers from the industry. It&#8217;s a fantastic platform for building relationships and establishing our presence in the industry.</p>
<p>Fernando: I couldn&#8217;t agree more. Networking and making personal connections are essential for success in our business. People prefer to work with someone they know and trust, and events like this allow us to create those connections.</p>
<p><em>Could you share some examples of how making personal connections at trade shows has led to new business opportunities for A Customs Brokerage?</em></p>
<p>Fernando: Sure! At this year&#8217;s show, I had a great conversation with a manufacturer from Italy. We discussed the challenges of international shipping and how our customs brokerage services could help streamline their operations. This connection could potentially lead to a new client for our business.</p>
<p>Gabriel: Similarly, I connected with a distributor from Brazil at the show. We bonded over our shared love of soccer, and by the end of the conversation, they expressed interest in working with us to handle their imports. It&#8217;s amazing how casual conversations can open doors for new opportunities.</p>
<p><em>Interviewer: It&#8217;s clear that establishing new connections is essential. However, how do you nurture existing relationships in this kind of setting?</em></p>
<p>Gabriel: Nurturing relationships is just as vital as establishing new ones. Trade shows like Coverings allow us to meet some of our long-time clients in person and strengthen our relationships with them. It&#8217;s essential to show that we value their business and are committed to their success.</p>
<p>Fernando: Exactly. Attending these events also helps us stay informed about the latest trends and innovations in the industry. By staying at the forefront of our field, we can offer our clients the best possible service and support.</p>
<p>Gabriel and Fernando Rodriguez&#8217;s experiences at the Coverings trade show demonstrate the importance of personal connections and networking in the world of business. By engaging with others, finding common ground, and nurturing relationships, businesses can unlock new opportunities and pave the way for continued success.</p></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As President of A Customs Brokerage, I recently had the privilege of attending MANIFEST: The Future of Logistics, tech conference in Las Vegas, where industry leaders and innovators gathered to share their insights on the latest technology trends and their impact on international logistics and domestic distribution.&nbsp; During my time there, I had the opportunity to reflect on the importance of visibility, data accuracy, communication, and interaction in the world of customs brokerage.</p>



<p>Visibility is Key</p>



<p>Visibility is a critical aspect of any successful business, and the same applies to customs brokerage. With the increasing complexities of global trade, having a clear and accurate view of your supply chain is vital. It not only helps in making informed decisions but also helps in preventing potential delays, losses, and other issues that might arise during the customs clearance process.&nbsp; We are please at ACB to offer online visibility and tracking options not only showing ETA information but also Customs data, workflow processing and important milestone events in the supply chain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Everyone is Talking About Accurate Data</p>



<p>Data accuracy has become a hot topic in the customs brokerage industry, and for good reason. Inaccurate data can cause significant problems for businesses, including delays in customs clearance, additional costs in demurrage and detention, and even legal consequences. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s crucial for customs brokers to invest in systems and processes that ensure the accuracy of the data they collect and share. This not only helps in reducing the risk of errors but also helps in improving the overall efficiency of the customs clearance process.</p>



<p>The Importance of Communication and Interaction</p>



<p>Good communication and interaction are key to the success of any business, and customs brokerage is no exception. By establishing clear and effective communication channels with clients, suppliers, and other stakeholders, customs brokers can ensure that all parties are on the same page and working towards the same goals. This helps in avoiding misunderstandings, resolving conflicts, and ensuring a smooth customs clearance process.</p>



<p>In conclusion, my time at MANIFEST in Las Vegas was an eye-opener and a great opportunity to reflect on the importance of visibility, accurate data, communication, and interaction in the customs brokerage industry. I am confident that by focusing on these key areas, we can continue to provide our clients with the best possible service and help them succeed in today&#8217;s global trade environment.</p>

<p>By Fernando Rodriguez, VP at A Customs Brokerage </p>



<p>I recently returned from attending the TISE and KBIS trade shows, and I wanted to share some of my reflections from these exciting events. As the Vice President of A Customs Brokerage, I was thrilled to have the opportunity to connect with leaders and innovators in the tile and stone industry and learn about the latest trends and advancements.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>One of the key takeaways from the shows was the importance of inventory management for importers. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>With a growing demand for tiles and stone products, it&#8217;s essential for importers to have a robust inventory management system in place to ensure that they&#8217;re meeting the needs of their customers and staying ahead of the competition. At A Customs Brokerage, we understand the importance of inventory and work closely with our clients to ensure that their supply chains are optimized and their products are delivered on time and in the right quantities.</p>



<p>Another positive trend that I noticed at the shows was the overall optimism and positivity in the industry. Despite the challenges posed by the current global climate, industry leaders and participants were upbeat and excited about the future. This optimism is a testament to the resilience and innovation of the tile and stone industry, and I&#8217;m proud to be a part of it.</p>



<p>Finally, I was struck by the importance of relationships in our industry. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Whether it&#8217;s between manufacturers and suppliers, suppliers and customers, or customers and end-users, strong relationships are the foundation of a successful business. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>At A Customs Brokerage, we understand the value of building relationships with our clients, partners, and colleagues. That&#8217;s why we work hard to provide the highest level of customer service and build long-lasting partnerships based on mutual trust and respect.</p>



<p>In conclusion, my time at TISE and KBIS was both educational and inspiring, and I&#8217;m looking forward to continuing to support and grow the tile and stone industry. If you&#8217;re in need of customs brokerage, freight forwarding, or warehousing services, I invite you to get in touch with A Customs Brokerage and see how we can help you achieve your goals.</p>



<p>Best regards,</p>



<p>Fernando Rodriguez<br>Vice President, A Customs Brokerage</p>
